# SCPL(Simplified C Programming Language) - Compiler Design Project

## About the project.
This is a project aimed at designing a compiler for the SCPL Language. SCPL is a simplified version of C Programming language which has most of the constrains present in C. The language definition for SCPL given [here](https://github.com/yazary/scpl-compiler-design/blob/master/SCPL-Language-Specification.md) is not the final one and it goes on changing as I add more and more constructs to the language. First phase of the project is Lexical analysis, Parsing, Syntax and Semantic Analysis. For that I'll be using the standard tools: Lex and Yacc. After that focus will be on the stages Intermediate Code generation, Machine Independent Optimizations, Assembly translation and Machine dependent optimizations. The scope of the project may change over time and I'll keep things updated here.

## Tools Used <Will be updated as I use more tools>:
1. [Lex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/) : For lexical analysis.
2. [Yacc](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/yacc/) : For Semantic Analysis
